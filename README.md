# Campus Paths Finder

A Java application that finds and visualizes the shortest path between two campus buildings using multiple pathfinding algorithms. Designed to simulate campus navigation by allowing users to interactively select locations and see optimal routes displayed on a map.

## Features

- Supports multiple graph search algorithms:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**
- Computes the optimal path between any two buildings on campus
- Interactive **graphical user interface (GUI)** that:
  - Displays building options
  - Draws the computed route on a visual campus map
- Modular architecture for extending additional algorithms or UI elements

## Technologies Used

- Java (core logic, data structures, GUI)
- Java Swing / AWT (for rendering the campus map)
